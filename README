Python package containing code to test development of Bayesian Neural Networks

Author: Ethan Goan

How to run:

1) Install dependencies:
   Anaconda - https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python
   Tensorflow - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ (can just install CPU version, current code not computationally expensive)
   Edward - http://edwardlib.org/getting-started (to install just run pip install edward)

2) add this package to your python path
   To do this, run in bash shell (sorry windows users)
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to where you cloned this repo>

3) All scripts are located in the bin directory
   the ./bin/bayesian_nn script contains most of the programs of interest
   to get information on these programs, run
   ./bin/bayesian_nn -h

   To get more information on an individual program, run
   ./bin/bayesian_nn <name of individual program> -h


Examples:

Running the test-gp-prior with 1 hidden unit and 1 hidden layer
./bin/bayesian_nn test-gp-prior -dims 1 1 1 --dist normal --mean 0 --var 5 --iter 1000

Running the test-gp-prior with 100 hidden unit and 1 hidden layer
./bin/bayesian_nn test-gp-prior -dims 1 100 1 --dist normal --mean 0 --var 5 --iter 1000

Changing the variance of the prior placed over model parameters
./bin/bayesian_nn test-gp-prior -dims 1 100 1 --dist normal --mean 0 --var 10 --iter 1000


After running one of the above scripts, lets plot the data
Say we used 3 hidden units for a single hidden layer
./bin/bayesian_nn plot-prior-tests ./3/3.npy 3 3.eps
